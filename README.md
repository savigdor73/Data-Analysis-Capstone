## Executive Summary

- **Top Programming Languages**: JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, Bash/Shell/PowerShell, Python.
- **Top Database Skills**: MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB.
- **Popular Platforms**: Windows, Linux, Docker, AWS, Slack.
- **Popular Web Frameworks**: jQuery, Angular, React.js, ASP.NET, Express.
- **Future Trends**: Growing demand for Python, SQL, and TypeScript.

## Introduction

The project aims to analyze the trends in programming languages, databases, and frameworks by examining data from the Stack Overflow Survey 2019. This analysis will help identify:
- The most popular technologies today.
- Trends in technologies desired by developers for future work.
- Ways to align job market requirements with developer interests.

## Methodology

- **Data Source**: Stack Overflow Survey 2019 (88,883 developers).
- **Tools Used**: IBM Cognos Analytics for data analysis and visualization.
- **Process**: Data collection, wrangling, visualization, and analysis.

## Results

- **Programming Language Trends**: Python has overtaken Java, moving into the top five most preferred languages. JavaScript remains the most widely used language.
- **Web Frameworks**: jQuery is the most widely used, with React.js gaining popularity over Angular.
- **Demographics**: The majority of respondents are men, with a higher representation of women among student respondents.

## Programming Language Trends

- HTML/CSS and JavaScript continue to dominate, mainly for front-end development.
- A shift from scripting languages to full-stack languages like JavaScript and C# indicates rising demand for full-stack development skills.
- Growing interest in C# suggests an increased demand for it in governmental and professional sectors.

## Database Trends

- **Current Trends**: MySQL is the most used DBMS, followed by Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL.
- **Future Trends**: PostgreSQL is expected to be the most desired SQL database, with a strong interest in NoSQL and cloud databases for scalability and flexibility.

## Discussion

- The combination of Docker, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript is crucial for modern web development in the cloud.
- Legacy systems, such as those using jQuery and Angular, are expected to remain relevant.
- The survey sample shows potential gender and age biases, which could impact the results.

## Overall Findings & Implications

- **Programming Languages**: Pythonâ€™s growth positions it as a key language for data and back-end roles. Companies should consider React.js for modern front-end development.
- **Databases**: Increased interest in NoSQL databases reflects the need for scalable, flexible solutions.

## Conclusion

As the tech landscape evolves, companies are encouraged to:
- Integrate more JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and NoSQL systems.
- Modernize legacy systems with cloud-based databases to keep developers engaged and up-to-date.
